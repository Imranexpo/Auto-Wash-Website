so we have two folders

client and server

client - will hold our frontend
server - will hold our Express Server

Lets create the component now!!

remember that these will be in differen routes/pages
so we need to create routes...

i think its clear

lets build these pages now...

so ok we have all the components and styling almost done.
Im going to make it responsive first and get to implement the backend and dashboard component
